tudedude assignment 3.py  two task 

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
we are giving number first 
created function where we are passing this number
checking if that number is less than 2 if yes , it will print answer 1
if number is greater than two else stateme nt trigger and it will calculate further
now we passing this functional function to variable and printing it

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
imported math module
Given value as input
defined value and took from math module for square root
defined value and took from math module for log function
defined value and took from math module for sine function
